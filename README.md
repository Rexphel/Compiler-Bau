# MiniJava


## Usage

1. Make sure you use Java JDK version 17 or hihger (Theoretically it should work with version 12+ but it's not tested.)

2. Make sure that you're in the root directory of the project

3. Run `make`. This compiles the program and creates necessary files.

4. Run `java Main < YOUR_FILE_HERE.java` in order to run a custom Java class
